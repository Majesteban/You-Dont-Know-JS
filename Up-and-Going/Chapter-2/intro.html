  <h1>Chapter 2: Into JavaScript</h1>
  <p>In the previous chapter, I introduced the basic building blocks of programming, such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. This chapter will focus specifically on things you need to know about JavaScript to get up an dgoing as a JS developer.</p>
  <p>This chapter will be more of an overview of the topics covered in detail throughout tht rest of this series.</p>
  <p>Especially if you are new to JS, you should expect to spend quite a bit of time reviewing the concepts and code examples here multiple times. Any good foundation is laid brick by brick, so don't expect that you'll immediately understand it all the first pass through.</p>
