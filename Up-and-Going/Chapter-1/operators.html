  <h1>Operators</h1>
  <p>Operators are how we perform actions on variables and values.</p>
  <p>The = equals operator is used for <em>assignment</em> -- we first calculate the value on the <em>right-hand side</em> (source value) of the = and then put it into the variable that we specify on the <em>left-hand side</em> (target variable).</p>
  <p>Consider:</p>
  <div class="example">
    <p>a = 2;</p>
    <p>b = a +1;</p>
  </div>
  <p>Here, we assign the 2 value to the a variable. Then, we get the value of the a variable (still 2), add 1 to it resulting in the value 3, then store that value in the b variable.</p>
  <p>While not technically an operator, you'll need the keyword <span class="highlight">var</span> in every program, as it's the primary way you <em>declare</em> (aka <em>create</em>) variables.</p>
  <p>You should always declare a var by name before you use it. But you ony need to declare a var once for each scope; it can be used as many times after that as needed. For example: (result also in dev console)</p>
  <div class="example">
    <p>var a = 20;</p>
    <p>a = a + 1;</p>
    <p>a = a * 2;</p>
    <p>console.log ( a ); //42</p>
  </div>
