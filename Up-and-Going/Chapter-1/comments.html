  <h1>Code Comments</h1>
  <p>One of the most important lessons you can learn about writing code is that it's not just for the computer.  Code is every bit as much, if not more, for the developer as it is for the compiler.</p>
  <p>You should strive not just to write programs that work correctly, but programs that make sense when examined. Code commenting is an imporatant part of that.</p>
  <p>Some observations and guidelines to good commenting</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Code without commenting is suboptimal.</li>
    <li>Too many comments (one per line, for example) is probably a sign of poorly written code.</li>
    <li>Comments should explain <em>why</em>, not <em>what</em>. They can optionally explain <em>how</em> if that's particularly confusing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are two types of comments possible.</p>
  <p>Consider:</p>
  <div class="example">
    <p>// This is a single line comment.</p>
    <p>/* But this is <br><span class="tab"></span>a multiline<br><span class="tab"></span>comment. */</p>
  </div>
  <p>the <span class="highlight">//</span> single-line comment is appropriate if you're going to put a comment right above a single statement, or even at the end of a line. Usually short.</p>
  <p>the <span class="highlight">/*..*/</span> comment is appropriate if you have several lines worth of explanation. It can appear anywhere on a line, even in the middle of a line.</p>
