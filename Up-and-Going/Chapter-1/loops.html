  <h1>Loops</h1>
  <p>Repeating a set of actions until a certain condition fails -- in other words, repeating only while the condition holds -- is the job of programming loops; loops can take different forms, but they all satisfy this basic behavior.</p>
  <p>A loop includes the test condition as well as a block (typically as <span class="highlight">{..}</span>). Each time the loop block executes, that's called an <em>iteration</em>.</p>
  <p>Consider: <span class="highlight">while</span> and <span class="highlight">do</span> loops</p>
  <div class="example-group">
    <div class="example">
      <p>
        var numOfCustomers = 10;
      </p>
      <p>
        while (numOfCustomers > 0) { <br>
        <span class="tab"></span>console.log( "How may I help you" ); <br>
        <br>
        <span class="tab"></span>//help the customer... <br>
        <br>
        <span class="tab"></span>numOfCustomers = numOfCustomers - 1; <br>
        }
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <p>
        do { <br>
        <span class="tab"></span>console.log( "How may I help you?"); <br>
        <br>
        <span class="tab"></span>//help the customer <br>
        <br>
        <span class="tab"></span>numOfCustomers = numOfCustomers - 1; <br>
      } while ( numOfCustomers > 0 );
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The only practical difference between these loops is whether the conditional is tested before the first iteration <span class="highlight">(while)</span> or after the first iteration <span class="highlight">(do..while)</span>.</p>
  <p>In either form, if the conditional tests as <span class="highlight">false</span>, the next iteration will not run.  That means if the condition is initially <span class="highlight">false</span>, a <span class="highlight">while</span> loop will never run, but a <span class="highlight">do..while</span> loop will run just the first time.</p>
  <p>Sometimes you are looping for the intended purpose of counting a certain set of numbers, like from <span class="highlight">0</span> to <span class="highlight">9</span> (ten numbers). You can do that by setting a loop iteration variable like <span class="highlight">i</span> at value <span class="highlight">0</span> and incrementing it by <span class="highlight">1</span> for each iteration.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">Warning:</span>Programming languages almost always count things in a zero-based fashion, meaning starting with <span class="highlight">0</span> instead of <span class="highlight">1</span></p>
  <p>The conditional is tested on each iteration, much as if there is an implied <span class="highlight">if</span> statement inside the loop.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Another specialized loop is the <span class="highlight">for</span> loop. For example:</p>
  <div class="example">
    <p>
      for (var i = 0; i <=9; i = i + 1) { <br>
      <span class="tab"></span>console.log( i ); <br>
    }
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>The <span class="highlight">for</span> has three clauses: the initialization clause (<span class="highlight">var i=0</span>), the conditional test clause(<span class="highlight">i <= 9</span>), and the update clause (<span class="highlight">i = i + 1</span>). So if you're going to do counting with your loop iterations, <span class="highlight">for</span> is a more compact and often easier form to understand and write.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The "loop until a condition fails" concept holds no matter what the form of the loop.</p>
