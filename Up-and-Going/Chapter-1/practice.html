  <h1>Practice</h1>
  <p>Write a program with the following requirements.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of money in your bank account. You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your mental spending threshold.</li>
    <li>After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.</li>
    <li>Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.</li>
    <li>You shoud set up some constants for the "tax rate," "phone price," "accessory price," and "spending threshold," as well as a variable for your "bank account balance."</li>
    <li>You should define functions for calculating the tax and for formatting the price with a "$" and rounding to two decimal places.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Challenge:</strong> Try to incorporate input into this porgram, perhaps with the <span class="highlight">prompt(..)</span> covered in "input" earlier. You may prompt the user for their bank account balance, for example. Have fun and be creative!</li>
  </ul>
