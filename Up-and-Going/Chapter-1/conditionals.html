  <h1>Conditionals</h1>
  <p>Conditionals are decision points in your program.</p>
  <p>Most common is the <span class="highlight">if</span> statement.  Essentially, you're saying, "<em>If</em> this condition is true, do the following...". For example:</p>
  <div class="example">
    <p>var bank_balance = 302.13;<br>
       <span class="tab"></span>var amount = 99.99;</p>
    <p>if (amount < bank_balance) {<br>
       <span class="tab"></span>console.log( "I want to buy this phone!");<br>
     }</p>
  </div>
  <p>The <span class="highlight">if</span> statement requires an expression in between the parentheses that can be treated as either <span class="highlight">true</span> or <span class="highlight">false</span>.</p>
  <p>You can provide an alternative if the condition isn't true, called an <span class="highlight">else</span> clause.</p>
  <p>Consider:</p>
  <div class="example">
    <p>const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;</p>
    <p>var bank_balance = 302.13;<br>
       var amount = 99.99;</p>
    <p>amount = amount * 2;</p>
    <p>// can we afford the extra purchase?<br>
       if ( amount < bank_balance ) {<br>
        <span class="tab"></span> console.log( "I'll take the accessory!" );<br>
        <span class="tab"></span> amount = amount + ACCESORY_PRICE; <br>
       } <br>
       //otherwise: <br>
       else { <br>
         <span class="tab"></span>console.log( "No, thanks." ); <br>
       }</p>
  </div>
  <p>Values that aren't already of an expected type are often coerced to that type. The <span class="highlight">if</span> statement expects a <span class="highlight">boolean</span>, but if you pass it something that's not already <span class="highlight">boolean</span>, coercion will occur.</p>
  <p>JS defines a list of specific values that are considered "falsy" because when coerced to a <span class="highlight">boolean</span>, they become <span class="highlight">false</span>.  Any other value not on the "falsy" list is automatically "truthy" -- when coerced to a <span class="highlight">boolean</span> they become <span class="highlight">true</span>.</p>
