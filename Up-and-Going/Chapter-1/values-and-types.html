  <h1>Values and Types</h1>
  <p>Different representations for values are called <em>types</em> in programming terminology. JS has built-in types for each of these so called <em>primitive</em> values</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For Math: <strong>number</strong></li>
    <li>To print a value on the screen: <strong>string</strong> (one or more characters, words, sentences)</li>
    <li>To make a decision in your program: <strong>boolean</strong> (<strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Converting Between Types</h3>
  <p>If you have a <strong>number</strong> but need to print it on the screen, you need to convert the value to a string. This is called "coercion". </p>
