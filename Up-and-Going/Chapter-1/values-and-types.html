  <h1>Values and Types</h1>
  <p>Different representations for values are called <em>types</em> in programming terminology. JS has built-in types for each of these so called <em>primitive</em> values</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For Math: <strong>number</strong></li>
    <li>To print a value on the screen: <strong>string</strong> (one or more characters, words, sentences)</li>
    <li>To make a decision in your program: <strong>boolean</strong> (<strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Converting Between Types</h3>
  <p>If you have a <strong>number</strong> but need to print it on the screen, you need to convert the value to a string. This is called "coercion".</p>
  <p>JS provides facilities for forcibly coercing between types. For example:</p>
  <div class="example">
    <p>var a = "42";</p>
    <p>var b = Number( a );</p>
    <p>console.log( a ); //42</p>
    <p>console.log( b ); //42</p>
    <p><em>see results also in dev console</em></p>
  </div>
  <p>The string "99.99" and the number 99.99 are the same value but expressed by two different types. One could say they are "loosely equal."</p>
  <p>JS will sometimes implicitly coerce values to matching types.</p>
  <p>Implicit coercion can and should be learned if you want to take JS programming seriously.</p>
  <p>This will be covered in later chapters.</p>
